# DSX Game Helper Extended (DSX GHE)

A program that launches and kills [DSX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812620/DSX/) when running specified games so you don't have to open it manually every time. The original DSX Game Helper was created by [@raritytiks](https://github.com/raritytiks). I forked from their repository and expanded upon it with some additional features, so please support them!

## Additions to OG Program
* The ability to autodetect games from a specified folder
* A dedicated settings page for the following features:

  - Pointing the program to DSX
  - Options for starting the program on bootup and starting in tray
  - Optional notifications for when DSX launches and closes, if an error occurs, or if a new update is available
    
* Dynamic tray icon improvements
* The ability to drag and drop exes to add them
* Option to open games directly from DSX GHE (default off)
* The ability to edit Game Name
* EXE icons next to Game Name
* Select programs before deleting, with select all option available
* Scrolling through lists
* Updated to .NET 8

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Any version of DSX
- [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.408-windows-x64-installer)

### Installation

1. Download the latest release of the program from the [Releases](https://github.com/raritytiks/dsx-game-helper/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

**DISCLAIMER:** I built the original release off of being able to use it with V1 of DSX as that is what I personally use (hence the path option and path scanning in the settings window).
