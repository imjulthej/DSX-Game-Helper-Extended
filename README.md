# DSX Game Launcher

An app that launches and kills [DSX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812620/DSX/) when running specified games so you don't have to open it manually every time. Originally created by [@raritytiks](https://github.com/raritytiks), I forked from their repository and expanded upon it with some additional features, so please support them!

**DISCLAIMER:** I built the original release off of being able to use it with V1 of DSX as that is what I personally use (hence the path option and path scanning in the settings window).
